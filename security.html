    <h1>Security & Protection</h1>

    <p>
      Protecting your accounts and personal information is a top priority at Chase Bank.
      We use advanced security measures and continuous monitoring to help safeguard
      your financial data and online activity.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Secure encryption technology to protect data in transit and at rest</li>
      <li>Continuous monitoring for suspicious or unauthorized activity</li>
      <li>Multi-layer authentication and identity verification</li>
      <li>Automatic session timeouts to reduce unauthorized access</li>
      <li>Fraud detection systems operating 24/7</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Role in Staying Secure</h2>
    <p>
      While we take strong measures to protect your account, your actions also play
      an important role in security. We recommend that you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep your username, password, and PIN confidential</li>
      <li>Use strong, unique passwords and update them regularly</li>
      <li>Never share one-time codes or verification details</li>
      <li>Sign out of your account after each session, especially on shared devices</li>
      <li>Ensure your device software and browsers are up to date</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fraud Awareness</h2>
    <p>
      Chase Bank will never ask for your password, PIN, or full authentication
      details through email, text messages, or unsolicited phone calls.
      Be cautious of unexpected requests for personal or financial information.
    </p>

    <h2>Account Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
      You are encouraged to regularly review your account activity and transaction
      history. If you notice any unfamiliar or suspicious activity, report it
      immediately through official Chase support channels.
    </p>

    <h2>Session & Device Security</h2>
    <p>
      For your protection, inactive sessions may automatically sign out.
      Accessing online banking from public or unsecured networks
      may increase security risks.
    </p>

    <h2>Security Updates</h2>
    <p>
      Security practices and technologies evolve over time.
      Chase Bank may update its security features and recommendations
      to maintain the highest level of protection.
