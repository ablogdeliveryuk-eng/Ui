    <p>
      Welcome to Chase Bank Help & Support.
      Here you’ll find guidance and information to help you manage your account,
      complete transactions, and stay secure while banking online.
    </p>

    <h2>Account Access & Sign-In</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re having trouble signing in, ensure your login details are entered correctly
      and that your device has a stable internet connection.
      For security reasons, multiple unsuccessful sign-in attempts may temporarily limit access.
    </p>

    <h2>Transfers, Payments & Requests</h2>
    <p>
      Before completing any transaction, review all details carefully.
      You will be asked to confirm recipient information, amounts, and notes
      prior to authorization using your transaction PIN.
    </p>

    <h2>Transaction Status</h2>
    <p>
      Once a transaction is completed, a confirmation receipt will be generated.
      You can review transaction details within your account activity section.

    <h2>Security & Fraud Protection</h2>
    <p>
      Chase Bank monitors account activity for unusual or unauthorized behavior.
      If you notice anything unfamiliar, we recommend taking immediate action
      to protect your account.
